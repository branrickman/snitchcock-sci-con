## Con-head orientation

* Get a list of programmers and technical folks
	* establish an understanding of who will be available (people come and go during scav, but it's a good idea to get a sense of who the few regulars will be)
* Establish that saying "that doesn't *need* electronics/programming/etc" is our number 1 priority. We could literally do nothing but talk people out of programming things and be pulling our weight on the team
*  Understand the breakdown of items
	* showcase
	* big points
	* everything else
* Understand that we are managers firstly. We help people get things done and make sure things don't get dropped.
* Apparently the team is flush with cash, so we have money to blow on buying the most likely used supplies (although we usually have people show up with tech shit and just buy what we need as the hunt starts)
